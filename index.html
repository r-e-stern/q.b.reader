    You are about to play a round of <i>Star Trek</i> trivia. The round is structured in a Quiz Bowl format: you
    will have an opportunity to answer twenty-four "tossup" questions, which will earn you ten points each — or fifteen
    if you can answer early enough — but you'll lose points if you answer incorrectly before the question ends.
    Each "tossup" answered correctly will allow you to answer its "bonus" questions: three related questions for ten
    points each. <br/><br/> Got that? Great. Onwards!
